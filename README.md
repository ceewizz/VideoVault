## Description

The motivation behind this project was to test our knowledge of what we've learned throughout the course and to culminiate it into a full stack web application. We were able to build a full stack  application using our knowledge of Javascript, SQL, Node,Sequelize, Express-session, and cookies.The project that we created is called VideoVault, its a full stack web application that store links of video, as well as images from multiple social media. The idea was how difficult it was to find old gif and memes, so we we'd figured to make it easier to save it inside a vault where you'll have easy access to whenever you want! This challenge introduced us on what we can do behind the scenes. Understanding how to use terminal, we learned that we were able to do many things such as retrieving data, storing data, and how we can manipulate and do many great things with it.It was definitely different from our previous project, which was just front-end, but was very fascinating on how it coincides. Completing this project helped us realize what we are capable of doing and takes us one more step to the right direction and hopefully innovate other devlopers like us. 




Throughout the development of this project, We gained valuable insights into the following areas:
  
- **Sequelize and ORM Implementation**: Making use of Sequelize, an ORM for Node.js, has deepened our understanding of database interactions within a JavaScript environment. Sequelize allowed us to translate complex SQL queries into readable JavaScript code. It also allowed usto design models and relationships to bridge the gap between object-oriented programming and database management. By abstracting database queries, uscan ensure consistency across different SQL dialects and efficiently integrate databases into Node.js applications.

  
- **Express.js**: our experience with Express.js has deepened our understanding of web server frameworks. This framework is a significant improvement over handling complex routing purely with JavaScript. It streamlined the process of creating server routes, managing incoming HTTP requests, and developing a RESTful API. Moreover, usgained valuable insights into request processing and how middleware functions play a role in processing requests.

- **SQL Proficiency and Database Management**: Using ourSQL has significantly enhanced our ability to write complex queries and database operations. ushave becousfamiliar SQL syntax and principles, which usapplied to create, modify, and query a database effectively. This ensures that our future APIs depend on databases with robust and reliable architecture. This experience solidified our grasp on schemas, database management, and best practices.
  
  
- **Node.js and Server-Side JavaScript**: Using Node.js has allowed usto create a server-side run environment for JavaScript. Thus, Node.js allows usto use JavaScript not just for front-end but also for back-end development. Also, ushave gained a deeper understanding of the non-blocking I/O model that Node.js employs. This knowledge is useful for creating web applications that can handle several operations at the saustime.
  

- **Environment Variables for Secure Configurations**: Making use of environment variables in Node.js allowed usto securely store sensitive information like database credentials. This ultimately enhanced the security aspect of our applications moving forward.
